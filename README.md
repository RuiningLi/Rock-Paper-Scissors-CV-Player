# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CV-Player

### Motivation

Most agents I find online that aim to play real-time "rock paper scissors" with a human player take human input directly rather than detecting human gestures. Then they use pattern recognition techniques or reinforcement learning to try to beat its opponent.

Well, this doesn't seem too trustworthy to me. Who knows what the algorithm is doing in the background? Maybe it's just taking your input and choosing the superior movement with some random noise. Thus, I decided to develop an agent that takes the human input from a front-facing camera. It's very challenging to train this agent, but it's a lot of FUN!

### How To Play with It

You can test whether you are a superior player to this agent by following the steps: 

- Clone the repository to your local machine;
- Run the Python script "video_processor.py";
- Follow the instructions on the screen to play with the agent.
